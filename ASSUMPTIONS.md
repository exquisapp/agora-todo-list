# Assumptions Made

This document outlines the assumptions made during the development of the Todo List application based on the provided requirements.

## Storage and Persistence

**Assumption**: localStorage is sufficient for persistence requirements
- **Rationale**: Since the app is single-user and single-device, localStorage provides adequate persistence across browser sessions without requiring a database setup
- **Impact**: Data persists when navigating away and returning to the app, but data is tied to the specific browser on the specific device
